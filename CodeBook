The run_analysis.R script performs the data collected and tidied, followed by the 5 steps required in the course project’s definition.

   1. Download the dataset
        Dataset downloaded and extracted under the folder called UCI HAR Dataset

   2. Assign each data to variables
        features <- features.txt : 561 obs, 2 variables
        The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.
        activities <- activity_labels.txt : 6 obs, 2 variables
        List of activities performed when the corresponding measurements were taken and its codes (labels)
        data_train_x <- test/X_train.txt : 7352 obs, 561 variables
        contains recorded features train data
        data_train_y <- test/y_train.txt : 7352 obs, 1 variables
        contains train data of activities’code labels
        data_train_Subject <- test/subject_train.txt : 7352 obs, 1 variables
        contains train data of 21/30 volunteer subjects being observed
        data_test_x <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 obs, 561 variables
        contains recorded features test data
        data_test_y <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 obs, 1 variablesns
        contains test data of activities’code labels
        data_test_subject <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 obs, 1 variables
        contains test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects being observed

    Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
        X (10299 obs, 561 variables) is created by merging data_train_x and data_test_x using rbind() function
        Y (10299 obs, 1 variables) is created by merging data_train_y and data_test_y using rbind() function
        subject (10299 obs, 1 variables) is created by merging data_train_Subject and data_test_subject using rbind() function
        merged_Data (10299 obs, 563 variables) is created by merging subject, Y and X using cbind() function

    Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
        Mean_std_data (10299 obs, 88 variables) is created by subsetting merged_Data, selecting only columns: subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement

    Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
        Entire numbers in code column of the Mean_std_data replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of the activities variable

    Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
        code column in Mean_std_data renamed into activities
        All Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
        All Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
        All BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
        All Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
        All start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
        All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time

    From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
        Tidy_data (180 obs, 88 variables) is created by sumarizing Mean_std_data taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after groupped by subject and activity.
        Export Tidy_data into TidyData.txt file.
